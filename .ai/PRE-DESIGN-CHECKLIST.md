> **Customized for Lost Monster website redesign**
>
> **Purpose:** Ensure design variations meet Lost Monster's quality standards before implementation
>
> **Minimum Threshold:** 80/100 points

## 🎯 Purpose

**Problem:** Design principles get forgotten during implementation, leading to:
- Inconsistent brand execution
- Design patterns that don't match Lost Monster's positioning
- Quality drift over time
- Website that doesn't demonstrate Lost Monster's methodology

**Solution:** Mandatory checklist ensures design principles are verified BEFORE choosing final design variation.

## ✅ The Checklist Structure

### Category 1: Framework Adherence (25 points)

**Why this matters:** The website must demonstrate Lost Monster's framework-driven approach. If we don't follow our own principles, we lose credibility.

- [ ] **CODA planning documented** (5 points) - CODA plan exists and is referenced

## 🛑 STOP Checkpoint

**Before choosing a design variation, ask yourself:**

1. **Did I check EVERY item above?**
2. **Can I honestly check ALL boxes?**
3. **If this were deployed tomorrow, would it demonstrate Lost Monster's methodology?**
4. **Does it match Lost Monster's positioning (premium, systematic, results-focused)?**
5. **Would potential clients trust Lost Monster based on this design?**
6. **Does it score 80+/100?**

**If you answer "NO" or "UNSURE" to ANY question:**
- **STOP**
- Identify which criteria are failing
- Make targeted improvements
- Re-score until 80+ achieved

**Only proceed when ALL criteria are met and score is 80+/100.**
