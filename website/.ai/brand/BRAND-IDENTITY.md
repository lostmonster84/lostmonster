## Who We Are

**Lost Monster** is a development company built by someone who runs businesses, not just codes for them.

### The Core Truth

- **Business owner first, developer second**
- I build systems for my own businesses to reduce costs
- I understand business problems because I live them daily
- I use modern development tools to work faster and cheaper
- I deliver quality without the agency markup

### What This Means

When you work with Lost Monster, you're working with someone who:
- Gets frustrated by the same expensive software subscriptions you do
- Has built custom systems to replace them
- Understands ROI because I manage it myself
- Won't sell you features you don't need
- Knows what "good enough to ship" actually means

- Explains advantage (business understanding)

## What We're NOT

### Avoid These Associations

❌ **"AI-Powered Development"**
- Sounds gimmicky, cheap, low-quality
- Use: "Modern development tools" instead

❌ **"Creative Agency"**
- We're not decorators
- We build systems that work

❌ **"Full-Service Digital Agency"**
- Too vague, too corporate
- We're focused, specific

❌ **"Award-Winning"**
- Don't care about awards
- Care about client results

❌ **"Innovative Solutions"**
- Buzzword garbage
- We solve problems, not innovate for innovation's sake

### Don't Pretend To Be

- Bigger than we are (solo/small team is a feature)
- Corporate/enterprise (we're agile and direct)
- Cheapest option (we're fairly priced, not cheap)
- All things to all people (we have focus areas)

---

## Geographic Positioning

### The Truth

- Based in Montenegro
- Clients primarily in UK/Scotland
- Work with businesses globally
- Location is irrelevant to quality

### How to Handle It

**DON'T:**
- Pretend to be Scottish (you're not)
- Use fake "Highland" imagery
- Play up geography as differentiator

**DO:**
- Be honest about being international
- Emphasize borderless nature of modern work
- Focus on client results, not location
- Mention UK client base if relevant

**Origin Story (When Asked):**
"Lost Monster started with work for Scottish clients (hence the Loch Ness Monster name), but we're international now. Based in Montenegro, working with businesses primarily in the UK and beyond. Location doesn't matter when you build quality systems and communicate clearly."
