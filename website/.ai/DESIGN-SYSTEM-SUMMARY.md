## Framework Relationship

### UNIVERSAL Framework (`.ai-framework/`)

These are **templates** that get adapted per project:
- CODA Planning methodology
- Design Variations workflow (5 options)
- Quality scoring system (80/100 minimum)
- Development principles

### Lost Monster PROJECT (`.ai/`)

This project's **specific implementation**:
- LOST-MONSTER-DESIGN-SYSTEM.md (design system)
- DOMAIN-KNOWLEDGE.md (business context)
- DESIGN-DECISIONS.md (why we chose this)
- PRE-DESIGN-CHECKLIST.md (scoring criteria)

---

## When Adding New Content

**Always:**
1. Use dynamic color system (respect user's choice)
2. Bold, confident typography
3. Personal voice (first-person)
4. Include real metrics
5. Dark backgrounds with gradients

**Never:**
- Corporate "we" language
- Vague promises without numbers
- Light backgrounds
- Small, timid typography
- Stock photos
