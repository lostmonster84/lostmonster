## 📊 MANDATORY SCORING - Rate Your Work Out of 100

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Before presenting ANY design solution, you MUST calculate and report the quality score.**

### Scoring System (Total: 100 points)

See [.ai/project/PRE-DESIGN-CHECKLIST.md](./.ai/project/PRE-DESIGN-CHECKLIST.md) for complete scoring breakdown.

### Grading Scale

| Score Range | Grade | Verdict | Action Required |
|-------------|-------|---------|-----------------|
| **90-100** | A - Excellent | ✅ Ready | Present to user immediately |
| **80-89** | B - Good | ✅ Acceptable | Present with minor improvement notes |
| **70-79** | C - Acceptable | ⚠️ Marginal | Present only if time-constrained |
| **60-69** | D - Poor | ❌ Redesign | Major issues - do not present |
| **0-59** | F - Failing | ❌ STOP | Complete redesign required |

### Required Presentation Format

**When presenting ANY design work, you MUST include this scorecard:**

```markdown
## 📊 Design Quality Score

**Overall Score: XX/100 (Grade: X)**

### Category Breakdown:
- [Category 1]: XX/XX (XX%)
- [Category 2]: XX/XX (XX%)
- [Category 3]: XX/XX (XX%)
- [Category 4]: XX/XX (XX%)
- [Category 5]: XX/XX (XX%)
- [Category 6]: XX/XX (XX%)

### Verdict:
[✅ Ready to present / ⚠️ Needs improvement / ❌ Requires redesign]

### Key Issues (if any):
- [List any items that scored ❌ FAIL]
- [List any items that scored ⚠️ PARTIAL]

### Improvements Needed (if score < 90):
- [Specific actions to reach 90+]
```

### Scoring Rules

**MANDATORY:**
1. **Calculate score BEFORE showing work to user**
2. **Include scorecard in every design presentation**
3. **DO NOT present work with score < 80** without explicit justification
4. **Track scores** in [.ai/project/DESIGN-SCORES.md](./.ai/project/DESIGN-SCORES.md)

**Why 80 is the minimum:**
- 80% = B grade = Professional quality
- < 80% = Has significant quality issues
- User deserves B+ work minimum
