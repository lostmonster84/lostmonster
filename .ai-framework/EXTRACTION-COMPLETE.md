```bash
# Create .ai directory structure
mkdir -p your-project/.ai/{core,frameworks,project}

# Option A: Symlink core files (recommended)
cd your-project/.ai
ln -s /path/to/lostmonster/.ai-framework/core ./core
ln -s /path/to/lostmonster/.ai-framework/frameworks ./frameworks

# Option B: Copy core files
cp -r /path/to/lostmonster/.ai-framework/core ./core
cp -r /path/to/lostmonster/.ai-framework/frameworks ./frameworks

# Copy and customize project templates
cp /path/to/lostmonster/.ai-framework/project-template/PROJECT-TEMPLATE.md \
   ./project/PROJECT.md

cp /path/to/lostmonster/.ai-framework/project-template/PRE-DESIGN-CHECKLIST.md \
   ./project/PRE-DESIGN-CHECKLIST.md

cp /path/to/lostmonster/.ai-framework/project-template/DESIGN-SCORES.md \
   ./project/DESIGN-SCORES.md
```

**Step 2: Customize Project Files**
1. Fill in PROJECT.md with your tech stack, design system, brand guidelines
2. Customize PRE-DESIGN-CHECKLIST.md categories for your project
3. Set up DESIGN-SCORES.md tracking
4. Create CLAUDE.md with link to Pre-Design Checklist

**Step 3: Start Using**
1. AI assistants read core files on first session
2. Follow WORKFLOW.md for all tasks
3. Use CODA for complex planning
4. Use Design Variations for all design work
5. Score all design work using Pre-Design Checklist
6. Track scores in DESIGN-SCORES.md

## 💡 The Three Critical Methodologies

### 1. CODA Planning Framework ⭐ VITAL

**Context → Objective → Details → Acceptance**

"Think twice, code once"

- Catches issues in planning (not after coding)
- Reduces wasted iteration
- Ensures shared understanding
- Maintains consistency

### 2. Design Variations Workflow ⭐ CRITICAL

**ALWAYS create 5 variations on demo page**

"The best design often isn't the first idea"

- Eliminates guesswork
- User sees real implementations
- Better outcomes through exploration
- Clear visual decision

### 3. Pre-Design Checklist + Scoring ⭐ CRITICAL

**100-point scoring, 80+ to present**

"Quantify quality objectively"

- Forces honest self-assessment
- Creates accountability
- Tracks improvement over time
- Prevents subpar work
