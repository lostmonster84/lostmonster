- [ ] **[Critical category] ≥ XX%** on all applicable work
- [ ] **Average score ≥ 85** across all work

### Medium-Term (Next 10 Designs)
- [ ] **Average score ≥ 90** (A- grade baseline)
- [ ] **Zero critical failures** (no auto-fails)
- [ ] **All categories ≥ 80%** (no weak areas)

### Long-Term (Ongoing)

## Notes

**How to Use This File:**
1. **After completing any design work**, score it using the checklist
2. **Record the score here** before presenting to user
3. **If score < 80**, redesign and re-score before presenting
4. **Track improvements** over time
5. **Review trends monthly** to identify weak areas

**Why Track Scores:**
- Creates accountability for quality
- Identifies patterns (weak categories, recurring issues)
- Measures improvement over time
- Prevents regression (scores dropping)
- Builds evidence of consistent quality

**Scoring Integrity:**
- Be honest with scores (don't inflate)
- Use objective criteria from checklist
- Document all partial passes (⚠️) with explanation
- Re-score after making improvements
- User trust depends on honest self-assessment
