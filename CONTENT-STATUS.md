## How to Complete

### Option 1: Manual Insertion
1. Open conversation transcript from January 9, 2025
2. Find each content section (clearly labeled with headers)
3. Copy/paste into respective placeholder files
4. Verify formatting (markdown headers, lists, etc.)

### Option 2: Automated Insertion
Use AI assistant to:
```bash
# Ask assistant to:
"Please insert the full [SECTION NAME] content that you created earlier
into website/[path]/[filename].md, replacing the placeholder text."
```

### Option 3: Leave as Placeholders
- Use placeholders as reminders of what content exists
- Reference conversation history when needed
- Insert content incrementally as website sections are built

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Create `systems-hq/` directory (internal frameworks)
2. **Then:** Decide whether to insert full content now or leave as placeholders
3. **Future:** Keep both `website/` and `systems-hq/` updated as frameworks evolve
