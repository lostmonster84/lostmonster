# Lost Monster - Development Agency Master Repository

> The single source of truth for all Lost Monster development work, components, frameworks, and best practices.

## Overview

**Lost Monster** is our development agency's centralized knowledge base and component library. This repository serves as the master HQ for all our work - a comprehensive Wikipedia of everything we build, use, and recommend.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to be:

- **Single Source of Truth** - Centralized knowledge base for all development work
- **Component Library** - Reusable, production-ready components across all frameworks
- **Design System** - Consistent UI/UX patterns, admin designs, and style guides
- **Integration Hub** - Documentation and code for third-party service integrations
- **Standards Repository** - Coding standards, best practices, and development workflows
- **Template Collection** - Project starters, boilerplates, and scaffolding tools
- **Knowledge Base** - Solutions, patterns, and learnings from real-world projects

## Getting Started

1. Browse the [documentation](./docs/) to understand our standards and practices
2. Explore [components](./components/) for reusable code across frameworks
3. Check [design-systems](./design-systems/) for UI/UX patterns and admin designs
4. Review [integrations](./integrations/) for third-party service implementations
5. Use [templates](./templates/) to kickstart new projects

## Philosophy

Lost Monster is built on principles of:

- **Reusability** - Write once, use everywhere
- **Documentation** - Every component and pattern is well-documented
- **Standards** - Consistent code quality and style
- **Modularity** - Independent, composable pieces
- **Best Practices** - Industry-leading patterns and approaches

## Contributing

This is a living repository. As we build new projects and discover better patterns, we continuously update and expand this knowledge base.
